# FCN

This repository includes a TensorFlow-based pipeline for semantic segmentation using the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. The code demonstrates preprocessing steps, model creation using a modified VGG16 architecture for Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN), and training procedures. It also showcases model evaluation metrics, including a custom implementation for calculating Intersection over Union (IoU) to assess segmentation performance.
