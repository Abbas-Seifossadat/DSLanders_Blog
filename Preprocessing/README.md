# Feature_Importance
This code snippet demonstrates the generation of a synthetic dataset and the application of a RandomForestClassifier to identify feature importances. It includes data creation, conversion to a pandas DataFrame, model training, and visualization of the results. The plotted bar chart illustrates the significance of each feature in the model's decision-making process.

# Handling_Missing_Values
The provided code snippet showcases three common techniques for handling missing data in a pandas DataFrame: dropping rows with any missing values, filling missing values with the column mean, and imputing missing values using KNN imputation. These methods are essential for data preprocessing before applying machine learning algorithms.

# Handling_Outliers_IQR_Method
The code snippet implements an outlier handling function using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. It calculates the IQR for the training data and applies thresholding to cap values in both the training and test sets, ensuring that extreme values do not skew the model's performance.


# Mutual_Information
This project demonstrates a feature selection process using mutual information in a synthetic dataset. It includes generating the dataset, calculating mutual information to rank features, and visualizing the results to identify the most informative features for a binary classification task.

# PCA
This code showcases a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a high-dimensional synthetic dataset to determine the number of components that capture significant variance, featuring data standardization, PCA fitting, and a cumulative variance plot for insightful dimensionality reduction.

# Polynomial_Vs_Linear_Regression
The code illustrates a comparison between linear and polynomial regression on a synthetic dataset with a quadratic relationship. It visualizes the fit of both models and evaluates their performance using mean squared error, demonstrating the superiority of polynomial regression for non-linear data.

# Handling_imbalanced_dataset
This Python script utilizes Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance in a synthetic dataset. It generates a dataset with a significant class imbalance, applies SMOTE to balance it, and displays the class distribution before and after the process.
